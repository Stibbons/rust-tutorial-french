That's all. Once accepted, the official documentation will be automatically updated.


How is it done?
===============

This github project is linked to the Read my Doc service, which triggers a rebuild of the online
documentation when changes are merged.

A travis build is also triggered (I prefere the notification from travis-ci).

Which tool to edit reStructuredText ?
=====================================

I'm mainly use Sublime Text 3 as my main editor and its quite usefull reStructuredText plugin

- Sublime Text 3: http://www.sublimetext.com/
- reStructuredText plugin: https://github.com/dbousamra/sublime-rst-completion

How to build ?
==============

- I've added the bash script and batch files to support Linux, Mac OS (with homebrew) and Windows compilations.
- You need Python and sphinx to build it. Install it along with the "pip" installer
- With pip, install sphinx with ``pip install sphinx`` (on windows you need to download the official installer)
- The easiest is to use the ``requirements.txt`` file: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
- On windows you need msysw to have the unix tools like ``bash``, ``make``...
